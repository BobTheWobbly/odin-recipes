    <h3><p>These breakfast potatoes almost made me want to make another batch they were so good! Serve with scrambled eggs.</p></h3>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 medium russet potatoes</li>
            <li>1 onion, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1/4 cup butter, cut into 4 pieces</li>
            <li>4 slices bacon</li>
            <li>1/4 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Cut potatoes into fourths and place in a large bowl with onion. Add olive oil, cumin, salt, and pepper; toss to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator until oven is preheated.</li>
            <li>Spread potato-onion mixture in an even layer on a baking sheet. Place butter on top of the potatoes, 1 piece at each corner.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>While potatoes are baking, cook bacon in a skillet over medium heat, stirring frequently, until evenly browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.</li>
            <li>Transfer cooked potatoes to a serving platter. Top with Cheddar cheese and bacon.</li>
        </ol>
